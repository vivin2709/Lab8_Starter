# Lab 8 - Starter


1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed - This will allow for iterative testing and since it is automated it will require much less effort from the developers and it becomes seamless with our dev process. Having it within an action that runs every times new code is pushed is directly in line with CI/CD. 

2) No, I would not use End 2 End Testing to check if a function returns correctly, I would use Unit Testing for that.

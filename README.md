# Lab 8 - Starter

1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed - This will allow for iterative testing and since it is automated it will require much less effort from the developers and it becomes seamless with our dev process. Having it within an action that runs every times new code is pushed is directly in line with CI/CD. 
2) No, I would not use End 2 End Testing to check if a function returns correctly, I would use Unit Testing for that.
3) No, I would use two unit tests to test the message feature since both typing and sending these messages would be associated with specific functions however, the entire feature cannot be tested using just a unit test, since it requires more in depth testing rather than just a singular function / individual unit of code. 
4) Yes, I would use a unit test to test the max message length feature since it is probably associated with a singular fucntion of a fixed unit of if else statements and would be appropriately tested using a unit test.
